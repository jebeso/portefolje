I always wanted a website and a place to put and share things I write. So now that I know some front end development, I just did it. This is what Chat GPT has to say about the code.

# Dream me up some code comedy

Once upon a time in the mystical world of Reactopia, a charming and clever programmer named Jens was working on a website to share stories of all kinds with the world. In Reactopia, code wasn't just a bunch of lifeless characters on a screen - it was alive, magical, and full of surprises. This was especially true when it came to the Stories component that Jens was crafting with love and care.

In his component, Jens used powerful spells like useState, imported from the React library, to manage the state of the app. One day, while working on the genre and language filters, Jens accidentally discovered a hidden magic within his code. When he combined the elements of Genre and Language with the powerful incantations of useState, the code came to life!

Suddenly, the stories on the website began to interact with each other, creating an entirely new realm of storytelling. IT stories merged with prose, forming tales of computers that wrote eloquent poetry. Fiction stories intertwined with the others, generating epic sagas about enchanted programmers and talking smartphones.

The language filter played its part in the magical chaos too. When Jens clicked the English language button, the stories exclaimed, "Hello, old bean! üçµ" in the most charming British accents. When he switched to Norwegian, they shouted, "Shit, it's p√• Norsk!" with a sense of bewildered excitement.

As Jens continued to refine the search functionality, the stories adapted to his every move. With every keystroke in the search bar, the characters within the stories would scramble to reassemble themselves, desperately trying to match the search term. When no posts remained, they would lament, "No English posts remain ü•≤," or simply, "No posts remain ü•≤," with a single tear rolling down their digital cheeks.

The enchanted code and the ever-evolving stories brought joy and laughter to the people of Reactopia. They marveled at Jens's creation, the magical Stories component that brought stories to life in a way that nobody had ever experienced before.

In the end, Jens became a legend in Reactopia. His enchanted code served as a reminder that in the world of programming, sometimes even the most ordinary lines of code could create something truly extraordinary and hilarious. And so, with a heart full of laughter, Jens continued his adventures in coding, always on the lookout for the next piece of magic waiting to be discovered.
