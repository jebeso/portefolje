excerpt: "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

For some reason I always wanted a blog and a place to put and share things I write. So now that I've learned a fair amount of front end development, I just did it. Maybe it can act as a portfolio and in addition to LinkedIn for various things I do.

I don't really have much else to say in this post, so I will let Bing write a story based on my code.

**\_Hello, this is Bing**. Howdy doody?\_

_A programmer was hired to create a blog post using Next.js and markdown. He spent hours writing the code, importing various components, fetching data from the API, converting markdown to HTML, and adding some styles. He was very proud of his work and decided to show it to his boss._

_The boss looked at the code and said: "This is terrible! You have too many imports, too many components, too much logic, and too much markup. This is not how you write a blog post. You need to simplify it and make it more readable."_

```
code
```

_The programmer was confused and asked: "But how do I simplify it? This is the best way to use Next.js and markdown. They are very powerful tools for creating dynamic web pages."_

_The boss replied: "You don't need Next.js and markdown. You just need a text editor and a browser. That's how you write a blog post."_

_The programmer was shocked and said: "But that's not how modern web development works. You need frameworks and libraries and APIs and preprocessors. That's how you create fast and interactive web pages."_

_The boss shook his head and said: "No, you don't. You just need plain HTML and CSS. That's how you create simple and elegant web pages."_

_The programmer was outraged and said: "But that's not how web design works. You need responsive layouts, animations, transitions, fonts, icons, colors. That's how you create beautiful and engaging web pages."_

_The boss smiled and said: "No, you don't. You just need words. That's how you create meaningful and compelling web pages."_

_The programmer was speechless and said: "But that's not how writing works. You need grammar, syntax, punctuation, spelling, vocabulary. That's how you create clear and correct web pages."_

_The boss laughed and said: "No, you don't. You just need jokes. That's how you create funny and popular web pages."_

_And then he fired him._
