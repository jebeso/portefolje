I don’t like [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism), so I decided to do something about my place in it. Even when I have nothing to hide, I don’t want to be watched. It’s just creepy.

The goal was to reduce *what* and *how much* data data i give away, from both security and privacy standpoints. Preferably without sounding too *whack* to people around me.

A later I feel in control, although I’m sure *actual* security people could easily poke holes in my setups. And, since I want stay a *human man with friends and a career*, I still have social media accounts. Tank wouldn’t want to plug me out of the Matrix just yet, but I wonder if  “going dark since 2022” will make me look *more* or *less* suspicious to our Future Corporate Overlords

# Wear the bucket on your head!
The day I properly sprung into action was the day I realized my Google Location History was a 780 megabyte text file.
 
### Personal Internet domain
The first step of staging a place for accessing stuff. I purchased a domain to serve all present and future hosting needs needs.

### Digital archive
To get out of Google Drive, I set up a self-hosted [Nextcloud Instance on a Raspberry Pi](https://nextcloudpi.com/). Initially, this was a bit of a hassle to get going, but today I have it set up with remote access, proper security certificates and multi-factored authentication.

This leaves me with an excellent replacement for Google Drive, Google Photos and all Office products. There are corresponding apps and sync on all platforms. I can even share files with friends and family, or even collaborate live on text.

### Note taking
This one was quite simple once I had my NextCloud server set up. I left Notion for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and all files are synced to across devices to my Nextcloud server.

### Email, calendar and VPN
My old Gmail forwards all email to my [Proton](https://proton.me/)-hosted email and calendar, which is set up under my personal domain. I also use Proton’s VPN for some things, although it’s not necessarily a great safety measure.

### Phone
I first had a go with [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) on my OnePlus 8T, but I believe it lacks some features for normal phone use. Later I purchased a Pixel device to use [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) with. This lets me be a normal man using normal apps, with some alternatives like NewPipe instead of YouTube. **All** apps are meticulously set up to **only** have the permissions **I let them** have. And don’t even get me started on the brilliance of [storage scopes](https://grapheneos.org/usage#storage-access).

### Messaging
Sounds simple, but is almost impossible in reality. However by some miracle I managed to get most of my close friends to switch to [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), along with most of my family. Wow!

### Browser
I’m one of those Firefox and DuckDuckGo guys now. What are you going do about it?

# I am The Captain now
I no longer pay for services with my eyeballs or personal data. Large corporations dont get to know *all about me*, and I don’t see ads in my online life. Best of all, i still get to be part of modern society.
