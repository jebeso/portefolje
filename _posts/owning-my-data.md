I found out my Google Location History was a 780 megabyte text file! That's when I decided to better protect my data ownership. The aim was to limit the amount and type of data I share, for both security and privacy reasons, while avoiding becoming a crazy person. Now I feel in control, although I'm certain actual security people could poke holes in my setup all day.

To get out of Google Drive, I set up a self-hosted [NextCloud Instance on a Raspberry Pi](https://nextcloudpi.com/). Initially, this was a bit of a hassle to get going, but today I have it set up with remote access, proper security certificates and multi-factored authentication. This gives me a great replacement for Google Drive, Google Photos and all Office products. There are corresponding apps and sync on all platforms, and I can share files and collaborate on office files.

My new note taking world is centered around [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), where all files are synced across devices to my NextCloud server. For mail, Gmail forwards all mail to my new [Proton](https://proton.me/)-hosted email and calendar, which is set up under my personal domain. I also use Proton’s VPN for some things, although I guess it's not necessarily a great safety measure... It makes me feel good.

For my Android device I had a go with [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/), but I later purchased a Pixel device to use [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/). This lets me use all normal apps, with some alternatives like NewPipe instead of YouTube. All apps are meticulously set up to only have the permissions I let them have. Tiring!

For messaging, I got most of my close friends to switch to [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), along with most of my family. It's an encrypted miracle!

Also, I’m one of those Firefox and DuckDuckGo guys now. What are you going do about it?

At the end of it all, I no longer pay for services with my eyeballs or personal data. Google doesn't get to know all about me, and I hardly ever see ads! I call that a win.
