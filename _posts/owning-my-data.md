Last year, I took action to better protect my data ownership. My aim was to limit the amount and type of data I share, for both security and privacy reasons, while avoiding becoming too extreme. Now, I feel more in control, though I am sure that actual security professionals could still identify weaknesses in my setup. Additionally, since I value being a normal person, I need to maintain social media accounts. I'm not ready to unplug, but the turning point for me was when I discovered that my Google Location History took up a whopping 780 megabytes in a text file.

### Digital archive
To get out of Google Drive, I set up a self-hosted [NextCloud Instance on a Raspberry Pi](https://nextcloudpi.com/). Initially, this was a bit of a hassle to get going, but today I have it set up with remote access, proper security certificates and multi-factored authentication. This provides an excellent replacement for Google Drive, Google Photos and all Office products. There are corresponding apps and sync on all platforms. I can even share files with friends and family, or even collaborate live on text.

### Note taking
This one was quite simple once I had my NextCloud server set up. I left Notion for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and all files are synced to across devices to my NextCloud server.

### Email, calendar and VPN
My old Gmail forwards all email to my [Proton](https://proton.me/)-hosted email and calendar, which is set up under my personal domain. I also use Proton’s VPN for some things, although it’s not necessarily a great safety measure.

### Phone
I first had a go with [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/), but I later purchased a Pixel device to use [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/) with. This lets me use all normal apps, with some alternatives like NewPipe instead of YouTube. All apps are meticulously set up to only have the permissions I let them have.

### Messaging
By some miracle I managed to get most of my close friends to switch to [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), along with most of my family.

### Browser
I’m one of those Firefox and DuckDuckGo guys now. What are you going do about it?

# Conclusion
I no longer pay for services with my eyeballs or personal data. Large corporations don't get to know all about me, and I hardlysee ads in my online life. Best of all, i still get to be part of modern society.
