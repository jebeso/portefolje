title: 'Sex Differences in Mate Preferences'
excerpt: "In 2016, as part of my master's degree in Social Psychology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I conducted and published a replication study. I quite enjoyed the publication process, though I never became a huge fan of the subject matter. It has ended up with more than 40 citations, however, so I guess you could say my academic career was short and impactful?!"
