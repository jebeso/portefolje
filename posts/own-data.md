Realizing my Google Location History was a large 780 MB .json file, I switched to more a privacy-centric setup. To replace Google Drive I deployed a self-hosted NextCloud instance on a Raspberry Pi with remote access and MFA. My notes are managed in Obsidian and sync with NextCloud. Proton is for email and calendar, my Pixel phone uses Graphene OS, I message with Signal, and use DuckDuckGo for searches.
